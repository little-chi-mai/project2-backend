# Project Two

>## I feel like

You know how sometimes when you are hungry, you just don't know where you want to go to eat? Or when there is a team lunch at work, and you want to try something new?

I feel like sets out to try and help you with that problem by leveraging a random search of places in your rough area using the Google Places API.
Once you find a place you are interested in , you are able to save the location to a wishlist & to also create an event at the location.

The site has a registered User model to allow the creation of user wishlists, storing of places to the wishlist and to create events at a place.
